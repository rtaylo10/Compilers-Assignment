A JFlex+Cup implementation for the C- language.

  Note that you need to modify the classpath in the Makefile so that it
will point to the directory where "java_cup" is located.  In my own setting,
classpath is java-cup-11b.jar since I simply put cup into the directory that I was working out of.

  To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate an executable program called "tiny".

  To test source code like "fac.cm", type 

    "java -classpath java-cup-11b.jar:. Main fac.cm" 

and the syntax tree will be displayed on the screen.

  To rebuild the parser, type "make clean" and type "make" again.
