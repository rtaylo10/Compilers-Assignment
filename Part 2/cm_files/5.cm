/* A program to compute the factorial value of an input - This is actually in the tiny language, in order to test	if the compiler can handle that amount of errors(this file was taken from the java_tiny example on the course website)*/

{ Sample program in Tiny language - compute factorial }

read x; { input an integer }
if x > 0 then { don't compute if x <= 0 }
  fact := 1;
  repeat 
    fact := fact * x;
    x := x - 1
